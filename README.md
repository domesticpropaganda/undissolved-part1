Snapshots from a century of plastics

## About
This project is a data-driven exploration and visual narrative about microplastic contamination over time. It draws from a range of peer-reviewed studies and global reports to trace the impact of microplastics across species and time.

## References
Foundational data includes the 1990 study on fish gut contents published in Environmental Science & Technology, as well as the 2000 findings on turtle plastic ingestion documented by the UNEP and NOAA. Human-related contamination is informed by studies such as Schwabl et al. (2018) on microplastics in human stool, and Ragusa et al. (2021) regarding plastic fragments in human placentas, both published in Environmental International and Environment International, respectively. Seabird data for 2020 references research by Wilcox et al. and the CSIRO, while projections for future contamination are grounded in modeling from the IUCN and OECD on plastic leakage trends and ecological impact. Additional information on plastic types, contamination pathways, and microplastic sources (such as synthetic textiles and tire wear) is sourced from reports by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, WWF, and the Plastic Pollution Coalition.

### Disclaimer

 While many data points are based on published research, others are projections or simplified representations created for narrative clarity.

This is not a comprehensive or authoritative dataset. Sources have been cited where possible, but due to the complexity of microplastic research and ongoing discoveries, figures and interpretations may evolve.

The intent of this project is to raise awareness and provoke thoughtâ€”not to provide definitive scientific conclusions.
