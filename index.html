      <h2>400 million tons of plastic waste in 1 year. </h2>
      <h3>Discarded, undissolved.</h3>
      <p> This project draws from a range of peer-reviewed studies and global reports to trace the impact of microplastics across species and time. Foundational data includes the 1990 study on fish gut contents published in Environmental Science & Technology, as well as the 2000 findings on turtle plastic ingestion documented by the UNEP and NOAA. Human-related contamination is informed by studies such as Schwabl et al. (2018) on microplastics in human stool, and Ragusa et al. (2021) regarding plastic fragments in human placentas, both published in Environmental International and Environment International, respectively. Seabird data for 2020 references research by Wilcox et al. and the CSIRO, while projections for future contamination are grounded in modeling from the IUCN and OECD on plastic leakage trends and ecological impact. Additional information on plastic types, contamination pathways, and microplastic sources (such as synthetic textiles and tire wear) is sourced from reports by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, WWF, and the Plastic Pollution Coalition. </p>
